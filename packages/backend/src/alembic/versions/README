# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

## Creating Migrations

Generate a new migration based on model changes:

```bash
prism db migrate -m "description of changes"
```

Or using alembic directly:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

## Applying Migrations

Apply all pending migrations:

```bash
prism db migrate
```

Or using alembic directly:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## Reverting Migrations

Revert the last migration:

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade -1
```

Revert all migrations:

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade base
```
